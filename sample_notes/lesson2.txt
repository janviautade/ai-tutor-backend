 Atmosphere The atmosphere is the layer of gases surrounding Earth, extending about 10,000 km from the
 surface. It is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and trace gases like carbon dioxide,
 argon, and water vapor. The atmosphere is divided into layers: troposphere (where weather occurs),
 stratosphere (ozone layer), mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere. It regulates Earth's temperature,
 protects life from harmful solar radiation, and transports heat and moisture around the planet, driving
 weather systems and climate patterns.
 Barometer A barometer measures atmospheric pressure, which is the weight of air above a specific point.
 Pressure changes are crucial in predicting weather. Falling pressure often indicates approaching storms,
 while rising pressure suggests fair weather. Mercury barometers use liquid mercury displacement, whereas
 aneroid barometers rely on a flexible metal chamber. Modern digital barometers integrate with
 smartphones and weather stations for real-time data.
 Climate Climate refers to long-term patterns of temperature, precipitation, wind, and humidity in a region,
 typically averaged over 30 years. Climates vary widely, from tropical rainforests and deserts to polar
 tundras. Factors influencing climate include latitude, altitude, ocean currents, and proximity to mountains.
 Climate classification systems, like Köppen-Geiger, divide Earth into zones such as tropical, arid, temperate,
 and polar, providing a framework for agriculture, urban planning, and disaster preparedness.
 Dew Point The dew point is the temperature at which air becomes saturated and water vapor condenses
 into dew, frost, or fog. It is a measure of atmospheric moisture and directly affects comfort levels and
 weather prediction. High dew points indicate humid conditions, while low dew points correspond to dry air.
 Meteorologists use dew point to forecast fog, frost, and thunderstorms.
 Evaporation Evaporation is the process of water changing from liquid to gas, primarily driven by solar
 radiation. It is a key component of the water cycle, contributing to cloud formation and precipitation.
 Factors affecting evaporation include temperature, wind speed, humidity, and surface area of water bodies.
 Evaporation also influences weather patterns, droughts, and the distribution of moisture across regions.
 Front A front is a boundary between two air masses with different temperatures and humidity levels. Fronts
 can be classified as cold, warm, stationary, or occluded. Cold fronts bring thunderstorms, heavy rain, and
 cooler temperatures, while warm fronts typically produce gradual precipitation. Stationary fronts cause
 prolonged rain, and occluded fronts combine features of both. Understanding fronts is essential for
 accurate weather forecasting.
 Greenhouse Effect The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases like CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O trap heat
 in Earth's atmosphere. This natural process maintains Earth's average temperature around 15°C, enabling
 life. However, human activities such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation have intensified the effect,
 leading to global warming, sea-level rise, and changes in precipitation patterns.
 Humidity Humidity is the concentration of water vapor in the air. Relative humidity is the percentage of
 moisture relative to the maximum the air can hold at a given temperature. High humidity can maketemperatures feel hotter (heat index), increase the likelihood of precipitation, and influence cloud
 formation. Low humidity causes dryness, which can affect health, agriculture, and wildfire risk.
 Isobar Isobars are lines on weather maps connecting points of equal atmospheric pressure. They reveal
 high-pressure systems (anticyclones) and low-pressure systems (cyclones), which dictate wind patterns and
 storm development. Closely spaced isobars indicate strong winds, while widely spaced isobars suggest calm
 conditions. Meteorologists use isobars to predict wind speed, storm movement, and weather changes.
 Jet Stream Jet streams are narrow, fast-flowing air currents in the upper atmosphere, typically 9–16 km
 above sea level. They influence weather by steering storms and affecting temperature distribution. The
 polar jet stream and subtropical jet stream impact mid-latitude weather, causing fluctuations like cold snaps
 and heatwaves. Changes in jet streams are linked to climate anomalies and extreme weather events.
 Kelvin (Temperature Scale) The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale used in science. Zero Kelvin
 represents absolute zero, the point where all molecular motion ceases. In meteorology, Kelvin is used for
 thermodynamic calculations, modeling atmospheric processes, and understanding heat transfer in climate
 studies.
 Lightning Lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge during thunderstorms. It can occur within clouds,
 between clouds, or between clouds and the ground. Lightning formation involves charge separation within
 clouds and rapid movement of electrons. It is associated with thunder, heavy rain, hail, and severe storms,
 and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation in ecosystems.
 Monsoon Monsoons are seasonal wind patterns that bring significant rainfall, particularly in South and
 Southeast Asia. They result from the differential heating of land and ocean, causing wind direction reversal.
 Monsoons impact agriculture, water resources, and regional economies. Failures or delays in monsoon
 onset can lead to droughts and crop losses.
 NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) NOAA is a U.S. agency responsible for monitoring
 weather, oceans, and climate. It provides weather forecasts, warnings, climate research, and satellite data.
 NOAA’s services are critical for disaster preparedness, marine navigation, agriculture, and climate policy.
 Ozone Layer The ozone layer in the stratosphere absorbs most of the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.
 Depletion, caused by CFCs and other pollutants, increases UV exposure, leading to skin cancer, cataracts,
 and ecosystem damage. Monitoring ozone is crucial for environmental protection and public health.
 Precipitation Precipitation is water released from clouds in forms such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. It results
 from condensation of water vapor, cloud formation, and atmospheric dynamics. Precipitation type and
 intensity depend on temperature, humidity, and air currents. It is essential for freshwater supply,
 agriculture, and ecosystem sustainability.
 Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) The QBO is a regular variation of stratospheric winds in the tropics with a
 period of approximately 28 months. It affects the distribution of ozone, tropical convection, and global
 weather patterns. Understanding the QBO helps improve long-term weather and climate predictions
Rainfall Rainfall measures the amount of water falling from clouds, usually in millimeters. Types include
convective (from localized heating), orographic (air forced over mountains), and frontal (along fronts).
Rainfall patterns influence agriculture, water supply, flooding, and ecosystem health.
Storm Storms are disturbed atmospheric conditions with strong winds, precipitation, and sometimes
lightning. Types include thunderstorms, cyclones, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and dust storms. Storm
monitoring and forecasting are vital for safety, disaster management, and infrastructure planning.
Temperature Temperature is a measure of thermal energy in the atmosphere. It affects weather patterns,
energy distribution, evaporation rates, and living conditions. Temperature extremes lead to heatwaves, cold
waves, and influence climate variability and human health.
Updraft Updrafts are rising air currents that contribute to cloud formation, thunderstorms, and severe
weather. They result from heating at Earth's surface, topography, or frontal lifting. Strong updrafts can
produce hail, tornadoes, and intense storm systems.
Visibility Visibility is the distance at which an object can be clearly seen. Reduced by fog, heavy rain, snow,
smoke, or dust, it affects transportation, aviation, and public safety. Meteorologists report visibility as part
of weather forecasts.
Wind Wind is air movement from high-pressure to low-pressure areas. It influences temperature, cloud
movement, and ocean currents. Wind energy is harnessed for power, and wind patterns are critical for
weather forecasting and aviation.
Xerothermic Conditions Xerothermic conditions are dry and hot, typical of deserts and arid regions. These
conditions affect vegetation, water resources, and soil quality, and are key in climate classification and
drought prediction.
Yield Impact of Weather Weather impacts agriculture and food production. Extreme events like droughts,
floods, frost, or heatwaves can reduce crop yields and affect food security. Monitoring weather patterns
helps farmers plan irrigation, planting, and harvesting.
Zephyr A zephyr is a gentle, mild wind, often signaling calm and pleasant weather. Zephyrs affect local
microclimates, air circulation, and can influence cloud formation and dispersal of pollutants.
